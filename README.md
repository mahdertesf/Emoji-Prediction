# Emoji Predictor with LSTM 🤖😊🔥

This project builds an LSTM-based classifier with custom word embeddings to predict emojis based on input sentences — enhancing user interaction in messaging apps through contextual emoji suggestions.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Model Type:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Task:** Sentence-to-emoji prediction (multi-class classification)
- **Embeddings:** Custom-trained word embeddings
- **Framework:** TensorFlow & Keras
- **Use Case:** Improving emotional/contextual expression in text communication

## 📘 Source

This project is part of the [DeepLearning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by Andrew Ng on Coursera (Sequence Models course).

## 🚀 Results

The model successfully maps short input sentences to appropriate emojis using sequential word understanding, demonstrating the power of custom embeddings and LSTM networks.
